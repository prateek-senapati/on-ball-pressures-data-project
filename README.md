# Nashville SC Technical Analytics Internship Data Project

This is my submission for a data project that I have to complete as a part of the Nashville SC 2021 Spring Internship selection process.

Here's the problem statement:
> For the project, you will be assuming the role of Data Engineer at an MLS club. You've been tasked with sending your supervisor a CSV containing a timestamped list of on-ball pressures (defending team player within 5 yards of the player in possession of the ball and moving towards the ball) from your last match.

> You have been provided the following files from the match:

> * Tracking Data (contains player and ball coordinates)
> * Metadata (contains player names and their playerID)
> * Documentation for the Tracking Data and Metadata files
> * Full match video of the game

You can find the project notebook [here](https://github.com/prateek-senapati/on-ball-pressures-data-project/blob/main/Nashville%20SC%20Technical%20Analytics%20Internship%20Data%20Project.ipynb). If the notebook or the images in the notebook aren't showing, try reloading the page or the notebook.
